Here's what each part of the code does:

variable "my_prefix" defines an input variable for the prefix you want to use in your tags.
resource "random_id" "tag_suffix" creates a random ID that you can use to ensure uniqueness.
locals { ... } defines a local value that concatenates the variable and the random ID.
In each resource (aws_instance and aws_s3_bucket), the tags block uses local.combined_tag to assign the combined value to the Name tag.

To execute this configuration:

Run terraform init in your configuration directory to initialize Terraform.
Run terraform plan to see the proposed changes.
Run terraform apply to apply the changes.

--------------------------------

Local values in Terraform are typically used in scenarios where you need to:

Reduce Repetition: If you find yourself repeating the same value or expression in 
multiple places within a module, you can define it once as a local value and then 
reference that local value elsewhere.

Simplify Complex Expressions: If you have a complex expression that you need to use 
multiple times, it can be cleaner to define it as a local value. This makes the 
Terraform code easier to read and maintain.

Create Derivative Values: When you want to create a value that is derived from 
other variables and needs to be used in multiple resources or outputs within the 
module.

Intermediate Values: Sometimes, you might need to compute an intermediate value 
that is used as part of a larger expression or in several other places.

Conditional Computation: When you have a value that might change based on a 
condition, locals can be used to define the logic in one place, making your 
resources and outputs cleaner.

Resource Naming and Tagging Conventions: To maintain consistent naming and 
tagging for resources within a module. As in your tagging example, a local 
value can be used to construct a base name or tag that is then appended or 
prepended to resource names or tags.

Defaults with Overrides: If you want to provide a default value that can be 
overridden by an input variable, a local value can be used to merge or choose 
between the default and the provided value.

Encapsulation: To limit the scope of a value to within a module, rather than 
exposing it as an input variable or output, which would make it module-wide or global.
